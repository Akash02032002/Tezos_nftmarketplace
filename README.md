# Mint It 

An **Mint It ( NFT Marketplace )** is a digital platform for buying and selling **NFTs**. This platform allow people to store and display their NFTs plus sell them to others for cryptocurrency or money.

## What are NFTs?
A non-fungible token is a unique and non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a digital ledger. NFTs can be used to represent easily-reproducible items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files as unique items, and use blockchain technology to establish a verified and public proof of ownership.

## API Reference

### Marketplace Contract

 A marketplace contract handles minting and managing the NFTs. We usually set this contract as admin of the NFT contract. Then we use inter-contract calling to mint, transfer, collect NFTs. There are some important features for a marketplace.
- Minting NFT
- Collecting NFT
- Transfering XTZ from contract to account. i.e. Collecting management rewards
- Updating admin
```bash
token: The address to the token contract.
```
```bash
metadata: Meta-data of this contract to make it recognizable in explorers.
```

```bash
admin: the admin for this contract,
```
```bash
token_id: we will use this to know the total number of NFTs we have minted.
```
```bash
data: This is a big map to save a particular token's data.
```
```bash
holder: The current owner of this NFT.
```
```bash
collectable: Whether the NFT is on sale or not.
```
```bash
author: The creator of the NFT.
```
```bash
amount: The amount at which this NFT will be sold, if the item is collectible
```
